## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable. As the blob moves, it experiences different emotions

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

---

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
